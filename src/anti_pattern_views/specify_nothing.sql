/*
Anti-pattern name: Specify nothing

Description: The specification is not done intentionally. Programmers are
             expected to work better without written specifications.

Detection: No specification artifact. There is no issue that will have something
           like "DSP, SPECIFICATIONS, ETC." in the title. Initially, meetings
           with the customer should be more frequent to clarify the project framework.
            No entry in the wiki with the project specification.
