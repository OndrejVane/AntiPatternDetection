/*
Anti-pattern name: Business as usual (No sprint retrospective)

Description: Absence of a retrospective after individual
             iterations or after the completion project

Detection: There will be no activities in the project
           that would indicate that a retrospective is
           taking place (issue with the name of the
           retrospective, issue on which all team members
           log, issue that is repeated periodically,
           issue to which no commit is bound, issue which
           will be marked as administration or something like that).
           There will be no notes in the wiki or other tool called
           retrospectives (% retro%).
